"""Pre-publication content guard.

Scans text for terms that must never reach a public commit — explicit
vocabulary, media filenames, provider/site names, personal identifiers. The
term list is deliberately *not* committed: a checked-in blocklist would itself
be a catalogue of the words we are trying to keep out of the public repo.
Instead the real list lives in a git-ignored overlay (``blocklist.local.txt``)
and only a tame ``blocklist.example.txt`` ships in the tree to document the
format.

The module is dependency-free and importable without the app, so the git hooks
in ``tools/githooks/`` and the unit suite can both call it cheaply — run it as
``python -m tools.sanitize_guard --staged`` or ``--message FILE``. Excerpts are
fully redacted (every matched term replaced with ``***``) so the guard's own
output never reproduces the content it is guarding against.

    A term whose first/last character is a word character gets a word-boundary

    punctuated term like ``site.co`` still matches literally.

    The two things a plain literal misses are the two things that leak:

    * **Separators.** A blocklist is written in prose — ``two word`` — and the
      leak arrives as a filename: ``two-word``, ``two_word``, ``two.word``,
      ``twoword``. So the gaps between a term's words match any run of spacing
      or joining punctuation, including none at all.
    * **Inflections.** ``badterm`` on the list did not catch ``badterms`` in a
      README, because the trailing ``(?!\\w)`` refused the plural. A short
      inflectional tail is allowed before that boundary.

    Both widenings were measured against every tracked file in all eleven repos
    before landing: they added no false positive, and they caught real names that
    had been sitting on a public ``main`` in slug form.
